NEMESISPY is an open source Python package I developed during my PhD. It can perform atmospheric retrievals on space telescope observations of exoplanets, which can help us understand their compositions. 

NEMESISPY can be used for parametric atmospheric modelling and radiative transfer calculation, and can be easily interfaced with Bayesian inference algorithms. 

 to retrieve information from space telescope spectra of exoplanets.
